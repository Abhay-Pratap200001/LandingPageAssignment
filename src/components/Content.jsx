          Helpdesk is a core part of the Capacity platform because support
          issues that cannot be resolved with automation must be escalated to a
          [human] agent. We spent a lot of effort building personas around the
          helpdesk agents so we could understand their needs.

          This wasn't a time-boxed project with a clear end date. Rather, this
          was work that evolved over time as we released an MVP to the market,
          observed how customers used it, and adjusted and iterated over time.
          The following shows, not all, but many of the features we designed and
          shipped to the delight of our customers.

          Helpdesk Message Composer UI - This part of the UI is a great example
          of when you need to pack a ton of important functionality in a
          relatively small space‚Äîall while making it look clean and enjoyable to
          use.

          Voice of Customer and competitor analysis made it clear that we were
          going to need to support public and private messages. There were
          concerns about mixing public and private messages in the same space
          because it may be hard to orient yourself in the conversation. I opted
          to use the tab component to bifurcate the experience at the highest
          level. User testing confirmed that this decision cut down on cognitive
          load because users can trust that everything in one area is public,
          and everything in another area is all private.

          Live Editing - Some user pain we uncovered was that there was no
          visibility into what agent(s) were working on a specific ticket. This
          often led to agents unknowingly editing a ticket at the same time, and
          that experience was confusing and frustrating if their work was undone
          or not saved.

          I designed options for how we might show user attribution during live

          <br /> Views As we interviewed helpdesk support agents we kept hearing
          a similar theme. In addition to the default filtered ticket views
          provided, agents wanted to create their own custom filtered views and
          be able to save the views.

          Not having to reconfigure special views several times a day gave a lot
